👾 Python Tic-Tac-Toe 🕹️

Welcome to a simple, yet sophisticated, implementation of the classic game! This project showcases clear structure and powerful AI in a command-line environment.
Features

    File Structure: Core logic is cleanly separated into game.py (game board and rules) and player.py (player behavior classes).

    Multiple Player Types: Supports Human (HumanPlayer), Basic AI (RandomComputerPlayer), and Smart AI opponents.

    🧠 Unbeatable AI: Includes a SmartComputerPlayer that utilizes the Minimax algorithm for guaranteed optimal play (will always win or draw). 🤖

    Turn-based Console Play: Provides real-time board rendering and turn prompts directly in the command line for a quick and engaging experience.

    Modular Design: The use of abstract base classes for Player makes it easy to add new AI strategies or player types in the future.
